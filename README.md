Practicing is very important for a developer and there are tons of concepts for an individual to know. Many of these concepts tend to make you a better developer, resulting in much more cleaner and quality code. Other tend to assist in quick thinking. Other tend to solve daily problems.

One thing is certain, a professional should be able to code cold these concepts, understand their value and usage and use them when the situation requires it.

This is a collection of various practicing examples, code of mine that I used and I use daily to practice. Feel free to walk around, read documentation or read through code. Do you have any sample to share? Feel free to contribute! The intention behind this repository is learning, this is its only purpose.
